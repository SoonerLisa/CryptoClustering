# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge
https://github.com/SoonerLisa/CryptoClustering.git

The first part of this challenge is complete. After completing part 1, I ran into errors in the beginning of part 2.
The repo CryptoClustering has the latest files. The third listed here is the most complete, using the others for different scenerios as I work through completing the code.
The three different attempts are .ipynb files:
Crypto_Clustering.ipynb
Crypto_Clustering_LM_Copy.ipynb
Crypto_Clustering_most_progressed.ipynb

Normal clause: No sources used except those within this course were used for this challenge.
